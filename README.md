## What is SharpCast TV?

SharpCast TV (shortened hereafter as SCTV) is a C# library designed to allow for interfacing with the Smashcast API. It will handle the procurement of API responses as well as allow the serialisation/deserialisation of the API responses once complete.

You can access the full Smashcast API at [this link](http://developers.smashcast.tv)

This project has now been archived due to the shutdown of Smashcast TV.
